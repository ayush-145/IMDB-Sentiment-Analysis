# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
Welcome to the IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis project! This repository showcases a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis using various machine learning models on the IMDB movie reviews dataset.
## Overview ##
This project leverages the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 highly polar movie reviews split equally into 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews. The goal is to build a sentiment analysis model to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Dataset ##
The IMDB movie reviews dataset is a popular benchmark for sentiment analysis and is highly balanced. It provides an excellent basis for training and evaluating sentiment classification models.
- Total reviews: 50,000
